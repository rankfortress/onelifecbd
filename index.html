	We formulate our Hemp Tinctures with MCT (Medium Chain Triglyceride/Coconut) oil. Coconut oil has manybenefits to humans and animals alike. Not only is it an excellent source of fatty acids, coconut oil is known for itsanti-microbial, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial properties and helps extend the shelf life and purity of theCBD tincture. MCT oil is more readily bioavailable and metabolized by the liver and has a faster absorptiontime than oils that need to go to the small intestines before being absorbed.
